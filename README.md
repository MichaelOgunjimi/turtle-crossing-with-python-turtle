The Turtle Crossing Game is a simple game created using Python's Turtle graphics library. The game involves helping a turtle cross a busy road without getting hit by oncoming cars.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your local machine.
- Python's built-in `turtle` module, which is included in the standard library.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the game files are located.
3. Run the `turtle_crossing.py` file using Python, e.g. `python turtle_crossing.py`, to start the game.

## Game Instructions

- The game is played using the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to navigate the turtle.
- The objective is to help the turtle safely cross the road without getting hit by the passing cars.
- The game level increases as the turtle successfully crosses the road, making it more challenging with faster cars.
- The player has three lives initially, which are represented by the turtles at the bottom of the screen.
- The game ends when the turtle gets hit by a car or loses all of its lives.
- The player's score is displayed on the top right corner of the screen and increases with each successful road crossing.

## Game Features

- Road with multiple lanes and cars moving from left to right.
- Turtle character controlled by the player to navigate the road.
- Collision detection to detect if the turtle gets hit by a car.
- Increasing game level with faster cars as the turtle successfully crosses the road.
- Lives counter to keep track of the remaining lives.
- Score counter to keep track of the player's score.

## Customization

The game can be customized by modifying the variables in the `turtle_crossing.py` file, such as the speed of the turtle and cars, number of lives, scoring mechanism, and game level difficulty.
